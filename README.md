# Understanding Global Suicide Rates: A Comprehensive Analysis

## I. Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an average of 800,000 people commit suicide worldwide each year. Suicide is becoming one of the most frequent means of death. However, due to cultural and social pressures, suicide incidence is often underestimated and misclassified, and may be completely unreported in some regions. As a result, comparing suicide rates between different countries may lead to statistically incorrect conclusions about suicide in different countries. Nevertheless, statistics are often used to directly influence decisions about public policies and public health strategies. In this blog post, we aim to understand global suicide rates by analyzing a dataset based on the suicide rate of 101 countries worldwide between 1958 to 2016.

## II. Dataset
Our dataset is based on the suicide rate of 101 countries all over the world between 1958 to 2016. We will analyze the suicide rate for each country based on different age groups and genders. We will explore the top 10 countries with the highest and lowest suicide rates in 1958 to 2016, and how that has changed throughout the closest 6 years from 2010 to 2016.
